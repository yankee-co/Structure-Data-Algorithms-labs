All the lab works over 2 semesters of discipline "Structure Data and Algorithms" in KPI (Kyiv Polytech Institute).
Main languages used are C and C++.
There are detailed reports (docx files).

**There are works on topics listed here:**

- Nested loops and dynamic programming algorithms
- Conversion of one-dimensional arrays (vectors) algorithms
- Binary search algorithms
- Modules
- Recursive algorithms
- Connected dynamic structures
- Linear search algorithms
  
etc...
